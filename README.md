## Udacity ComputerVision PeerReviewed SLAM Project
Project 3: Object Detection and Localization (**SLAM**)

![github-small](https://github.com/mminamina/Udacity_ComputerVision_PeerReviewed_Project---SLAM/blob/master/Awesome_FinalProject_Review.png)

This repository contains all of my work and comprehensive codes on Project3, the last project of CVND. 
- SLAM project helps me learn how to combine robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. 
- SLAM gives a way to track robot location in the world in real-time and identify landmarks locations such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. 
- This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
### Project Experience
I started working on Project2 and Project3 simultaneously three weeks after program started. I initially thought SLAM project would be quite difficult for me. That was why I started early. However, Sebastian Thrun and Cezanne Camacho explain the concepts in details. Hands-on exercises allow me to apply SLAM knowledge on real-world problems. Many thanks to Udacity Team for such a great learning experience. I am happy to say that I completed both projects in five days. Among all three, I received the best review for this project and was very satisfied with my work on SLAM. The subject matter itself is very challenging and interesting at the same time- my most favorite.
### SLAM Details 
- matrix omega is labelled with vector xi and landmarks Li;
- p_x, p_y for robot poses;
- l_x, l_y for landmark positions;
- dx represents movements
### Worklist
For project instructions, please refer to https://github.com/udacity/P3_Implement_SLAM

>The project is grouped into three Python notebooks; 
>the first two are for exploration of provided code and a review of SLAM architectures;
> only Notebook 3 and the robot_class.py files are graded.
